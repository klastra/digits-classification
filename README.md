# digits-classification
Utilizing Machine Learning models against Optical recognition of handwritten digits dataset from scikit-learn.org to obtain high accuracies for classification.


In this dataset, there are ten classes and each class correlates to a specific digit. There are 64 attributes, in which all input attributes are integers in the range 0 to 16, and the last attribute is the class code 0 to 9. There are approximately 180 samples per class, and 1,797 samples in total.

I will be building a Support Vector Machine model (SVM) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for this project. 

Accuracies will be printed out and determined by a confusion matrix.
